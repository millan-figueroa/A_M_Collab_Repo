****V I D E O  N O T E S Ultimate Study Tutorial (G R O W Method)
Grid - create a grid of your study topics
Rate - rate your difficulty using colors (red: clueless, yellow: needs work, green: understand)
Overall Outcome
Weakest - practice the red ones more
** H I G H L I G H T S
Think of your knowledge about topics as plants u gotta water so they grow
If lots of same color use last reviewed date
Prevents over studying easy topics
??? Q U E S T I O N S ????
Prospective review schedule?
Google sheets or Notion Template?
How do we customize it to learning code other than memorizing vocab?
**We decided GROW over ANKI would meet our needs best

TEch Job Market Notes
TTeams are changing to integrate 'stochastic' (unpredictable)
New tools to come but timeless principles & capacities become even more important
Long term engineers
5-15% didn't offset covid hiring, 22% layoffs, 28% recruiting in 22-23 layoffs.. 80% found new roles in 3 months
-VC investments cut
-In other industries layoffs like this are normal cycle, layoffs not as important as hiring freezes, venture capital investments cut
-System design is super important
-ML
-How to define the AI's workflow
-What at they hiring for? Not who. Convert society and team needs into tech systems (software)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Browser JS APIs, UI frameworks
-React is falling
-Next JS
-Web systems - http, browser environment(DOM)
-Servers/ Databases: Node, SQL, Redis, DJango
-Infrastructure: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure
-Dev tooling: Git, Bash scripting, Co-pilots, CI/CD
-ML adjacent: Data pipeline, API/Model deployment, Infrastructure, UX
-Programming lang: JS/Typescript, Python, Java, Go, Rust
Engineer understands the role of technology in systems
Technology implementation but with a new level of capacity
As a human wrestling with vast complexities and improve data and functionality, make it intuitive (edited) .
Fundamentals, Design/Architecture,
profiles in tech
Ability to turn client's needs into solutions, break down complex challenges and develop strategy for solving them
Domain knowledge
Building with stochastic element


Whiteboarding Workshop Notes (Get slides from Amanda/ Matt):

Understand the Problem
Create inputs and edge cases
Pseudo code solution in high level strategy
Write the solution
Test the solution
Evaluate the solution

Once question is clear, produce concrete inputs and outputs.

Understanding prlbme, pseudo coding, explaining shld take about 30% of your time
Do not talk while facing the board
